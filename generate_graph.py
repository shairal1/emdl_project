Your task is to:
1. Classify all the listed problems into coherent problem classes (e.g., Data Leakage, Feature Engineering Issues, Code Structure Problems, Reproducibility, etc.).
2. For each class, list the exact problem descriptions (preserve their wording as in the file).
3. Provide the total number of lines (i.e., occurrences) per class.

Output format:
Each line should contain:
[Class Name]: [list of problem descriptions as they appear]: [number of lines changed] ‚Äî [Total number of lines in this class]

Ensure:
 -remove any ':' in the problem descriptions
- The problem descriptions are **verbatim** from the original text.
- Each problem is listed under only one class.
- The total line count per class is accurate.

Use this input text (between triple backticks):
```{text}```"""
