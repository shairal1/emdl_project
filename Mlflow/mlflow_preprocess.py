You are an expert ML engineer.

Transform this Python pipeline code so that it uses MLflow for experiment tracking:

- Add `mlflow.autolog()` at the start.
-Start the tracking mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://127.0.0.1:5000")
  mlflow.set_experiment("Pipeline_track")
- Wrap the training and evaluation into an `mlflow.start_run(run_name=RUN_NAME)` context, where RUN_NAME is meaningful (use '{folder_name}_{file_name}' as run_name).
- Ensure that the metrics: F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall are logged explicitly with `mlflow.log_metric()`.
- Log the file name as mlflow.log_param("Pipeline", RUN_NAME)
- The code should run as is, with the logging additions and minimal restructuring and dont create a main function
- Use `import mlflow` if not already imported.
- Your code should be able to be executed right away
- Resolve syntax issues or scikit-learn version compatibility issues.
- Clean and restructure code only when necessary to ensure correct execution.
- Return a complete and clean version of the modified Python code â€” no explanations
- Return only the transformed Python code. Do not include markdown formatting like triple backticks or python. Just the raw code

Here is the original code:

```python
{code}
Return the transformed full Python code only, no explanations.
