# Understanding Aggregation Error in Data Pipelines
In machine learning data pipelines, aggregation errors occur when data is grouped or transformed in a way that introduces inaccuracies or misrepresents the underlying data distribution. Aggregation errors can arise from various data transformations, such as text normalization, temporal or spatial zooming, and other granularity changes. These errors can lead to skewed datasets, loss of information, and incorrect model predictions. This guide will explain the impact of aggregation errors, how they manifest, and practical steps to mitigate them.

## The Problem: Aggregation Errors
Aggregation errors can manifest in several ways. The following are some examples:

1. **Text Normalization**: Techniques such as lowercasing, stemming, or lemmatization can alter the distribution of text data, potentially grouping unrelated observations and introducing bias.

2. **Granularity Changes**: Modifying data granularity, such as replacing specific values with aggregated values from a coarser granularity or centralizing spatial data, can lead to loss of detail and introduce distributional changes.

3. **Grouping Errors**: When data is aggregated or grouped, unrelated observations may be combined, leading to erroneous conclusions and degraded model performance.

## Practical Advice

1. **Granularity Preservation**: Important data details should be preserved during aggregation. Overly broad aggregations that might obscure meaningful variations should be avoided.

2. **Aggregated Data Validation**: The aggregated data should be checked and validated to ensure that it accurately reflects the original data distribution and does not introduce bias.

3. **Usage of Appropriate Normalization Techniques**: Text normalization techniques should be applied after considering the impact on the data distribution. For example, stemming or lemmatization should be applied consistently and it should be validated that these transformations do not adversely affect model performance.

4. **Granularity Matching**: Changes in granularity (temporal or spatial) should be checked for appropriateness for the analysis and should not lead to loss of critical information. Methods that maintain relevant data granularity are recommended.

5. **Monitoring Data Distribution**: The distribution of data should be monitored before and after aggregation to detect any significant changes that could impact model performance.

6. **Bias Detection**: Techniques to detect and mitigate any biases introduced by aggregation errors should be implemented, such as evaluating model performance across different data segments.
