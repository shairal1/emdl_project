[Incorrect Text Normalization]: The code applies rudimentary text normalization by lowercasing and replacing hyphens, which is insufficient for real-world text data and can lead to poor model performance due to inconsistent text representations.
[Incorrect Spatial Aggregation]: Replacing the 'native-country' feature with 'North America' aggregates all countries into a single category, losing valuable location-specific information that could be predictive of salary.
[Lack of Feature Scaling Consideration]: While `Normalizer` is used, it may not be appropriate for all numeric features, and other scaling methods (e.g., `StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`) might be more suitable depending on the data distribution.
[Absence of Hyperparameter Tuning]: The `RandomForestClassifier` is used with default hyperparameters, which may not be optimal for the given dataset, leading to suboptimal model performance. There's no grid search or cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
[Missing Cross-Validation]: The model's performance is evaluated on a single train/test split, which may not be representative of the model's generalization ability. Cross-validation should be used to obtain a more robust estimate of performance.
[Potential Data Leakage]: The preprocessing steps, specifically imputation and normalization, are performed separately on the training and testing sets within the pipeline structure. The `fit` method is called on the whole pipeline. There's no explicit data leakage, but it is worth noting, particularly for more complex transformations.
