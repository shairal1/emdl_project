[Incorrect Text Normalization]: The 'occupation' column undergoes a flawed normalization process. Lowercasing is acceptable, but replacing hyphens with spaces may incorrectly aggregate different occupations into a single category, leading to information loss and potentially skewing the model's understanding of occupational impact on salary.
[Incorrect Spatial Aggregation]: The 'native-country' column is aggregated by replacing each country with 'North America'. This oversimplification discards potentially valuable geographic information that might correlate with salary, leading to a less accurate model. This is an example of spatial data aggregation that throws away information.
[Missing Cross-validation]: The model is trained and evaluated on a single train-test split. This doesn't provide a robust estimate of the model's generalization performance. Cross-validation should be used to assess how the model performs on different subsets of the data.
[Lack of Hyperparameter Tuning]: The RandomForestClassifier is used with its default hyperparameters. Tuning these hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, maximum depth) could significantly improve the model's performance.
[No Feature Importance Analysis]: The code does not include any analysis of feature importance. Understanding which features are most influential in predicting salary can provide valuable insights and potentially lead to feature selection or engineering improvements.
