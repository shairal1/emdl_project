[Incorrect Text Normalization]: The text normalization applied to the 'occupation' column is flawed; lowercasing and replacing hyphens with spaces might not be the correct or optimal way to handle text data in this column, potentially leading to loss of information or creation of unintended categories.
[Incorrect Spatial Aggregation]: Replacing all values in the 'native-country' column with 'North America' is an oversimplification that discards potentially useful geographic information, negatively impacting the model's ability to learn from the original data.
[Missing Data Handling]: The imputer strategy and fill values may not be optimal for all features and could introduce bias or reduce the model's performance. Using a 'median' strategy for numerical features and 'missing' for categorical features might not be the best approach for all columns.
[Limited Model Evaluation]: Model evaluation is limited to accuracy and a classification report. It does not include other relevant metrics or visualizations, such as AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, or confusion matrices, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
