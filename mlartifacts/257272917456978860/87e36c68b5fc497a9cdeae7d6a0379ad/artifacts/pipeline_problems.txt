[Incorrect text normalization]: The code performs basic text normalization by lowercasing and replacing hyphens, but it lacks more sophisticated techniques like stemming, lemmatization, or stop word removal, which could improve model performance.  
[Incorrect spatial aggregation]: The code aggregates all 'native-country' values into 'North America', which is an oversimplification that discards potentially valuable geographic information and introduces bias.  
[Lack of cross-validation]: The code uses a single train/test split, which can lead to overfitting and an unreliable estimate of the model's generalization performance. Cross-validation should be used to obtain a more robust estimate.  
[No hyperparameter tuning]: The RandomForestClassifier is used with default hyperparameters, which may not be optimal for the given dataset. Hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV should be employed.  
[Potential data leakage]: There is no explicit handling to prevent data leakage. Preprocessing steps like normalization and imputation should be performed separately on the training and testing sets to avoid information from the test set influencing the training process.
