[Incorrect Text Normalization]: The text normalization applied to the 'occupation' column performs lowercasing and replaces hyphens with spaces. While lowercasing is generally good practice, replacing hyphens with spaces might be too simplistic and could lead to unintended aggregation of distinct occupations or loss of information.
[Incorrect Spatial Aggregation]: The 'native-country' feature is aggregated to 'North America', losing potentially valuable information about more specific locations. This overly simplistic aggregation reduces the feature's granularity and predictive power.
[Lack of Feature Scaling Considerations]: While a Normalizer is used on numerical features, it might not be the most appropriate scaling method for all datasets. Other scalers like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler might be more suitable depending on the data distribution and the model used. There isn't a clear justification for choosing Normalizer.
[Absence of Hyperparameter Tuning]: The RandomForestClassifier is used with its default hyperparameters. Without hyperparameter tuning using techniques like cross-validation and grid search, the model's performance might be suboptimal.
[Missing Cross-Validation during Training]: The model is trained and evaluated on a single train/test split. This can lead to overfitting to the training data and an unreliable estimate of the model's generalization performance. Cross-validation should be used during training to obtain a more robust performance estimate.
[Potential Data Leakage]: The imputer is fit on the training data within the pipeline but applied to both the training and testing data. While this is done through a pipeline, it's crucial to ensure the test data isn't influencing the imputation strategy, which can lead to data leakage if the test data significantly differs from the training data.
